	\vspace{0.5em}
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=5.5mm, rightmargin=5.5mm]
        \item The Internet of Things (IoT) significantly enhances our daily activities through a myriad of applications and services provided by interconnected devices.
		\item IoT devices collect environmental data and monitor various events when connected to the internet, necessitating efficient integration methods with IoT applications.
		\item Named Data Networking (NDN) emerges as a potent solution to facilitate device and service integration, aligning with the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm for future network advancements \cite{ahlgren2012survey} \cite{zhang2010named}.
		\item This paper introduces a novel API tailored for IoT services in an NDN environment, refining the communication between IoT devices and services.
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{0.5em}

%%% II. Abschnitt %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{\textsf{API for IoT Services}}{name=abschnitt2,column=0, span=3, below=abschnitt1}{
	\vspace{0.5em}
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=5.5mm, rightmargin=5.5mm]
		\item IoT services provide crucial data from sensors and network environments, aiding decision-making processes \cite{hail2015iot}.
        \item The proposed API aims to streamline the incorporation of services within the IoT-NDN framework, as depicted in Figure 1.
		\item Services, acting as modular system components, are essential for delivering information from device sensors and network environments, aiding in decision-making across various sectors.
		\item The API's design ensures adaptability for any service within the IoT-NDN system, fostering seamless information sharing and retrieval.
		\item A service-oriented integration is emphasized, catering to the constraints of IoT devices and promoting real-time protocols and smart technology movements.
	\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5em}
	Naming Concept for IoT Services:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=5.5mm, rightmargin=5.5mm]
        \item NDN offers flexible data requests with hierarchically structured, human-friendly names \cite{amadeo2014named}.
		\item A structured naming concept is introduced for IoT services, which includes COMMAND, COMMAND ID, and COMMAND PARAMETER as illustrated in Figure 2.
		\item This naming structure enables the transmission of various information types and allows for the efficient retrieval of general service information.
	\end{itemize}

    Deployment of IoT Services:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=5.5mm, rightmargin=5.5mm]
        \item IoT services, small software units, monitor events and provide specific knowledge, enhancing decision-making efficiency.
		\item API architecture and service registration process demonstrated in Figure 3.
		\item Service integration involves the exchange of Interest/Data packets between IoT-Services and IoT-NDN layers.
		\item Example service registration for network time synchronization detailed, showcasing API's flexibility and integration benefits  \cite{zhang2010named}.
